title: Why I created scrt.link
lead: Self-destructing messages for the web
description: Scrt.link began as a side-project with the idea to share self-destructing messages. While similar tools existed, none combined privacy, security and great UX in the way I imagined such a product.

## The Beginning

It all started with the **idea of sending private messages**—in a fun way. Messages that don’t persist. Think Snapchat, but without compromising user privacy.

As with many ideas, a bit of research quickly revealed that similar solutions already existed: the first setback. However, I wasn’t entirely satisfied with what I found. Yes, tools like _One-Time Secret, Yopass, Privnote, and PrivateBin_ all offer something valuable—some excel in privacy and security, while others focus on UI. But I wanted a **combination of the best features**. And, most importantly, I wanted the tool to be fun. UX was where I felt I could add the most value.

This idea evolved into a project that could be summed up as **"Sharing secrets as a service."**

Like many side projects, the beginning was easy. In fact, I had a working prototype online after just one weekend—complete with a domain, a functional website, a database, and even a logo.

## The Next Phase

Then came phase two—the moment when the project starts to consume all your thoughts.

- _This feature_ would be fun.
- _That part_ needs a refactor.
- _What about monetization?_ I need to cover infrastructure costs.
- _Wait, do I need user accounts for that?_
- _Should I add proper terms and a privacy policy?_
- _Did I even choose the right framework?_

These are the thoughts that keep side projects from ever moving beyond the prototype stage. But thanks to the pandemic, I stayed focused. Three months later, I was confident enough to launch the project on **Product Hunt**—not expecting much, just looking for early feedback. And that brings us to today.

## Status Quo

### **What Scrt.link Is**

Scrt.link is a tool for **securely sharing sensitive information online** through end-to-end encrypted, one-time-use links.

There are currently three types of secrets users can share (_with secret file sharing under consideration_):

- **Text** – The default mode, ideal for sharing passwords and other confidential information. The recipient can copy the secret.
- **Link** – A one-time-use URL shortener. The generated link works only once.
- **Neogram™** – A digital, letter-style message that self-destructs after being read. Perfect for confidential notes, confessions, or secret love letters.

Scrt.link also offers **browser extensions** for all major browsers and provides both free and paid user accounts for power users and supporters. There’s even a **Twitter account** for updates.

### By the Numbers

- **778** secrets created
- **42** upvotes on Product Hunt
- **1** paying customer

## What’s Next?

This project was born out of curiosity and a desire to learn—and in that sense, it’s already a success. Along the way, I’ve gained hands-on experience in areas I previously knew little about: **backend development, databases, privacy, and even marketing**.

I still love this project, and I believe it has real value—perhaps even room to grow. However, **by the numbers, one could call it a failure**, which raises the question: is my time better spent elsewhere?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas, and wisdom.

Best,  
Chris
