# How to Securely Share Sensitive Information (Without Leaving a Trace)

We’ve all been there. You need to send a password, access token, or confidential link to someone — fast. But the usual suspects like email, Slack, or messaging apps just _feel_ wrong for it. You know deep down that once you hit “send,” that secret could be sitting in someone’s inbox forever… or worse, exposed.

That’s where [**scrt.link**](https://scrt.link) comes in.

## Why Sharing Secrets Is Risky Business

Most communication tools are built for convenience — not security. When you send a password through a chat or email:

- It might get indexed, backed up, or cached.
- You lose control over who sees it and how long it sticks around.
- Even “disappearing” messages can be screenshotted or stored (exposing context like your username or thumbnail).

And while enterprise solutions exist, they’re often clunky, overkill, or expensive. scrt.link is a simpler approach built for speed, privacy, and peace of mind.

## What Is scrt.link?

scrt.link is a one-time secret sharing service. You paste in sensitive content (like credentials, recovery codes, or private links), and it generates a unique, single-use URL. Once opened, the content vanishes.

Think: self-destructing messages — but with real privacy controls, metadata minimization, and end-to-end encryption.

No tracking, no trace, no nonsense.

## How It Works

1. Go to [scrt.link](https://scrt.link)
2. Paste your sensitive info — it could be a password, a file, or just a private message.
3. (Optional) Add a note for yourself, set an expiration, or require a passphrase.
4. You get a secure link to share. Once the recipient views it, the content is permanently deleted.

If you're on **scrt.link for Business**, you can also:

- Use your own domain (e.g., `https://secure.yourcompany.com/abc123`)
- Apply custom branding (logo, colors, theme)
- Control retention, access, and security settings

## Common Use Cases

Here’s where scrt.link shines:

- 🔐 Sharing login credentials with a teammate or freelancer
- 💸 Sending private keys to access bitcoin or other crypto wallets
- 🔧 IT and support teams distributing temporary access or recovery codes
- 💳 Executives securely sharing payment details with assistants
- 🔍 Journalists or researchers sending sensitive info with expiration

Basically, any time you don’t want something private to linger in inboxes, chats, or cloud logs — scrt.link helps you send it and forget it.
