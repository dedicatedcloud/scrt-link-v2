## Business Service Level Agreement

Last Updated April 29, 2025

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") describes the service availability commitment for scrt.link ("Service", "we", "us", "our") to its business customers ("you", "your").

### 1. Services Availability

We commit to using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the scrt.link service is available 99.99% of the time in any given calendar month, excluding Excused Downtime as defined below. **Uptime** refers to the total number of minutes in which the service is up and running and available during an applicable calendar month. Service availability is calculated as:

> **Uptime Percentage** = Uptime ÷ (Total minutes in month - Excused Downtime) x 100

System logs and monitoring tools will be used to determine uptime and identify any outage events.

### 2. Unscheduled Downtime

Unscheduled Downtime is defined as any period in which the scrt.link service is unavailable and unable to process or serve content to end users, excluding:

- Issues stemming from third-party services or infrastructure (e.g. Vercel, S3).
- Internet-wide disruptions or conditions outside our reasonable control.
- Maintenance announced with at least 48 hours’ notice.
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, war, government actions, etc.).

These excluded events are collectively referred to as **Excused Downtime**.

### 3. Compensation for Downtime

If scrt.link fails to meet the 99.99% availability target in a calendar month (excluding Excused Downtime), you will be eligible to receive a proportional extension of your service subscription based on the duration of the Unscheduled Downtime.

#### Compensation Formula

For every 30 consecutive minutes of confirmed Unscheduled Downtime beyond the SLA threshold, your subscription period will be extended by 1 day.

To request this compensation, you must submit a written request to support@scrt.link within 30 days of the downtime, including:

- Description and time of the outage
- Your user ID or organization name
- Logs or evidence, if available

We will verify the incident using our internal monitoring and determine eligibility in good faith.

Note: The maximum compensation will not exceed 30 days of service extension per calendar month.

### 4. Sole Remedy

This SLA outlines your sole and exclusive remedy for service unavailability or performance degradation. No financial refunds or credits will be issued unless explicitly agreed otherwise in a separate agreement.

### 5. Monitoring and Review

We use automated and manual systems to monitor uptime and performance continuously. These include infrastructure metrics, error tracking, and alerting systems. We may periodically update this SLA to reflect improvements or operational changes.
